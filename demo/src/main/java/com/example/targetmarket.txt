Unhappy,was eating a trail mix bag when i noticed a few of the peanuts had some white webbing (as seen in the picture of the peanut on the left side  there were several others too) loose in the bag and in the webbing were some darker brown specks all of the same size upon dumping the remainder of the trail mix baggie along with 3 other trail mix baggies for comparison the brown specks were unique to the webbed peanut bag the specks appeared to be either bug eggs or some critter's excrement not sure which is worse! had three other people verify the contents will never eat these again and do not recommend anyone else to eat these i contacted walmart and they did nothing be careful what you eat  it may be bug stuff from a filthy facility,0,0,0,protien
